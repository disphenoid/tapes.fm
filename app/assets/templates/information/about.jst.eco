      About
    </h1>
    <p>
      A few month ago I moved from Berlin to New York. After a little while I missed making music with my Band and friends back in Berlin and I started to search for ways to collaborate with them over the web. 
      <br /><br /> It quickly became clear that I need to build something by my self.
